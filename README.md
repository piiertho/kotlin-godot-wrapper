# Kotlin/Native wrapper for the Godot Game Engine

## Overview

This is a **Kotlin** language wrapper for the [**Godot**](https://godotengine.org/) game engine. It uses the [**GDNative**](https://godotengine.org/article/dlscript-here) utility to interact with **Godot**'s core api's. The wrapper provides you Godot API's as Kotlin classes, so you can write your game logic completely in Kotlin. It will be compiled into a dynamic library using [*Kotlin/Native*](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/native-overview.html). It contains GDNative bindings which allows Godot core and Kotlin code interact with each other.
You don't have to worry about any binding logic. Just write your game scripts like you would for [GDScript](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/scripting/gdscript/gdscript_basics.html) or [C#](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/getting_started/scripting/c_sharp/).
